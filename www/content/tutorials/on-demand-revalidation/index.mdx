[On-demand Revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation) makes it easy to update your Next.js site when content on Drupal is created, updated or deleted.

Next.js for Drupal supports On-demand Revalidation configurable per entity types. You can choose to revalidate content by path, or by tag. Tag-based invalidation is new as of Next Drupal 2.0 and allows you to invalidate content on your Next.js site using Drupal's powerful cache tag system.
