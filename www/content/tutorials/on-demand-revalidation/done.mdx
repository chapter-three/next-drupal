Congratulations. You have successfully configured on-demand revalidation for your entity types.

When you create, update or delete an entity in Drupal, your Next.js site will be revalidated to show the updates.

---

## What's next?

On-demand Revalidation is built on top of Drupal's Events API and Revalidator plugins.

If you'd like to customize, extend or provide your own revalidator plugin, see the documentation [here](/docs/revalidator).

See also the [Entity Events documentation](/docs/entity-events).
