One of the [most requested features](https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/nextjs-drupal-and-graphql-how-to-use-graphql-next-drupal) of Next.js for Drupal has been GraphQL support.

When we started working on Next.js for Drupal, GraphQL for Drupal was in between releases. We started looking into supporting GraphQL but version 4 shipped without schema definitions and onboarding took some learning.

We've been following the work done by the GraphQL team closely. A few months ago, [jmolivas](https://twitter.com/jmolivas) announced GraphQL Compose, _a GraphQL spec compliant schema generation for the GraphQL module v4.x_.

This is exactly what we've been waiting for.

Today, we are announcing `next 1.4` with support for GraphQL using GraphQL Compose.

```sh
composer require 'drupal/next:^1.4' 'drupal/graphql:^4.4' 'drupal/graphql_compose:^1.0@beta'
```

All the features of Next.js, including Preview Mode, work out of the box.

## GraphQL Starter

We built a new Next.js starter for GraphQL. Check it out:

```sh
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal-graphql-starter
