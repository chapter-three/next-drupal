Congratulations. You have successfully install, configure and connect a Next.js site to Drupal. 🎉

## What's Next?

Take a look at the [documentation](/docs) to learn more about:

1. [Data Fetching](/docs/data-fetching)
2. [Menus](/docs/data-fetching/menus)
3. [Authentication](/docs/authentication)
4. [Webforms](/docs/guides/webform)

## Need help?

We understand there's more than a few steps to properly configure Next.js for Drupal.

It is built this way for flexibility.

With the current setup, you can easily configure one Drupal backend and serve multiple Next.js sites (content hub).

You maintain control on which content is pushed to which sites and how.
