In this release of Next 1.3, the Drupal module, and Next-Drupal 1.5, we're introducing _Preview URL Generators_.

## Preview URL Generators

Preview URL Generators are used for generating URLs for preview mode with encrypted secrets.

Compared to the preview secrets used in previous releases, the new secrets are:

- Generated per requests
- Encrypted and not re-usabled
- Scoped to the current URL and user
- With expiration dates
- Validated by Drupal (no client validation)
- Pluggable (bring your own secret generator)

Upgrading to Next 1.3 is easy. See the upgrade guide [here](/docs/upgrade-guide).

Note: You should also upgrade to the latest `next-drupal` to use the new encrypted secrets.

## JSON Web Tokens

We are also introducing a new module, **Next.js JWT**, for using JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

Next.js JWT ships with a Preview URL generator that enables user-level access control for more granularity.

Next.js JWT ships as **experimental** in Next 1.3.
