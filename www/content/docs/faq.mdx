## Which Drupal versions are supported?

Next.js for Drupal works requires Drupal 9.3+ and Drupal 10.

## Does it work without authentication?

Yes. Authentication is only required for previewing unpublished entities and revisions.

You can use Next.js for Drupal for pulling public JSON:API data and building static pages without authentication.

## Something is not working. Help?

You can get help in the [issue queue](https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal/issues) on GitHub or in the #nextjs channel on [Drupal Slack](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C01E36BMU72).
