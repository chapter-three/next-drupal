title: Create OAuth Client
excerpt: Setup an OAuth client to be used for authenticated content.
weight: 110
group: Preview Mode
---

Before we can create an OAuth consumer, we need to create a new role and a user for OAuth scopes.

<Callout>

As from `next-drupal 1.5`, user roles are used for OAuth scopes. The scopes are automatically handled for the preview based on the currently logged in user.

</Callout>

---

## 1. Create Role

1. Visit `/admin/people/roles`.
2. Click on **+ Add role**.
3. Fill in the **Role name**. Example: _Next.js Site_.

---

## 2. Assign Permissions

Next, assign the following permissions to the newly created role.

- 'access content'
- 'access user profiles'
- 'issue subrequests'
- 'view all revisions'
- 'view any unpublished content'
- 'view latest version'
- 'view media'

<Callout>

We are assigning the _view all revisions_ and _view any unpublished content_ permissions to allow Next.js to access unpublished content and revisions.

This scope is only going to be used when making authenticated requests from Next.js to Drupal.

```ts
const articles = await drupal.getResource(
  "node--article",
  "dad82fe9-f2b7-463e-8c5f-02f73018d6cb",
  // highlight-start
  {
    withAuth: true,
  }
  // highlight-end
)
```

</Callout>

---

## 3. Create User

Add a new user at `/admin/people/create` and **assign them all the roles that are going to be used for scopes, including the role we created above**.

---

## 4. Generate keys

Generate a pair of keys to encrypt the tokens. Store them outside of your document root (`web` directory) for security.

1. Visit `/admin/config/people/simple_oauth`
2. Click **Generate keys** to generate encryption keys for tokens
3. Fill in **Directory for the keys**. For example a relative path like `../`
4. Click **Generate**
5. Click **Save configuration**

You can also use `openssl` to generate keys in the directory you used above:

```
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout > public.key
```

---

## 5. Create Consumer

1. Visit _/admin/config/services/consumer/add_
2. Fill in the following values:

- **Label**: `Next.js site`
- **User**: `Select the user we created`
- **Secret**: `Your secret`
- **Scopes**: `Select the role we created`

3. Click **Save**

_Important: note the client id (uuid) and the secret. These are going to be used as environment variables for the Next.js site._

---

## 6. Connect Drupal

To connect the Next.js project to Drupal, we use [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

Fill in the following variables in your `.env.local` file.

```txt title=.env.local
# Authentication (Bearer)
DRUPAL_CLIENT_ID=
DRUPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

---

## 7. Update DrupalClient

Update the `DrupalClient` to use the **Bearer** authentication header.

```ts title=lib/drupal.ts
import { DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"

export const drupal = new DrupalClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL,
  {
    auth: {
      clientId: process.env.DRUPAL_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.DRUPAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
  }
)
```
