title: Configure Authentication
excerpt: Setup an OAuth client for GraphQL requests.

To make GraphQL requests to your Drupal site, we need to configure [authentication](/docs/authentication).

We will use an OAuth Client for authenticating GraphQL requests.

Before we can create an OAuth consumer, we need to create a new role and a user for OAuth scopes.

---

## 1. Create Role

1. Visit `/admin/people/roles`.
2. Click on **+ Add role**.
3. Fill in the **Role name**. Example: _Next.js Site_.

---

## 2. Assign Permissions

Next, assign the following permissions to the newly created role.

- GraphQL Compose - Server: Execute arbitrary requests

---

## 3. Create User

Add a new user at `/admin/people/create` and **assign them the role we created above**.

---

## 4. Generate keys

Generate a pair of keys to encrypt the access tokens. Store them outside of your document root (`web` directory) for security.

1. Visit `/admin/config/people/simple_oauth`
2. Click **Generate keys** to generate encryption keys for tokens
3. Fill in **Directory for the keys**. For example a relative path like `../`
4. Click **Generate**
5. Click **Save configuration**

You can also use `openssl` to generate keys in the directory you used above:

```
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout > public.key
```

---

## 5. Create Consumer

1. Visit _/admin/config/services/consumer/add_
2. Fill in the following values:

- **Label**: `Next.js site`
- **User**: `Select the user we created`
- **Secret**: `Your secret`
- **Scopes**: `Select the role we created`

3. Click **Save**

_Important: note the client id (uuid) and the secret. These are going to be used as environment variables for the Next.js site._
