title: Route Syncing
excerpt: Sync route changes inside the iframe preview with your Drupal site.
---

Route syncing is a feature of the iframe preview. It captures route changes inside the iframe preview and syncs with the Drupal site.

_Example: if you navigate to an article node inside the iframe preview, route syncing will listen for this route change and redirect the Drupal site to the article node._

This is handy as it maintains editing context.

Route syncing supports translations and revisions.

## Configuration

1. On your Drupal site, visit `/admin/config/services/next/settings`.
2. Check **Sync routes**
3. Save.

Next add the following code to your `_app.js` file on your Next.js site.

```jsx
// highlight-start
import Router from "next/router"
import { syncDrupalPreviewRoutes } from "next-drupal"

Router.events.on("routeChangeStart", function (path) {
  syncDrupalPreviewRoutes(path)
})
// highlight-end

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // ...
}
```

>
  <>Turn on route syncing</>
</Img>

Restart your dev server.

If you visit a node on your Drupal site and click on any link inside the iframe preview, you should now see the route changes synced.

### Skipping Routes

If you want to disabled syncing for some routes, say routes present in your Next.js site and not in Drupal, you can do so by specifying the route paths under **Skip routes**.
