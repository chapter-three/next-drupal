1. Visit `/admin/modules`.
2. Enable the following modules: **Next.js** and **Next.js GraphQL**.

## Try GraphQL

If you visit `/admin/config/graphql/servers/manage/graphql_compose_server/explorer` on your site, you should see an example server created for you.

You can start testing GraphQL queries. Let's make our first request to fetch the first 5 articles.

Copy and paste the following in the query textbox and click run.

```graphql
query Articles {
  nodeArticles(first: 5) {
    nodes {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

You should see the first 5 articles returned on the right.
