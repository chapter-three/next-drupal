At the time of this writing, there are two patches we need to wire everything together.

1. Open your Drupal `composer.json` file.
2. Add the following patches under `"extra"`.

```json title=composer.json
"extra": {
		// highlight-start
    "patches": {
        "drupal/subrequests": {
            "Get same results on different request": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2019-07-18/change_request_type-63049395-09.patch"
        },
        "drupal/decoupled_router": {
            "Unable to resolve path on node in other language than default": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2021-05-05/3111456-34.patch"
        }
    },
		// highlight-end
}
```

3. Run the following command:

```sh
composer require cweagans/composer-patches
```
