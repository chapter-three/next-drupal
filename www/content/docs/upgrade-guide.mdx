<Callout>

`next-drupal 1.6.0` adds support for Next.js 13 and React 18. To update your site to Next.js 13, see the [Upgrading from 12 to 13](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading#upgrading-from-12-to-13) guide on the Next.js site.

</Callout>

## next 1.6.0

1. Upgrade your Drupal site to use `next 1.6.0`

```sh
composer require drupal/next
```

2. Run updates:

```sh
drush updb
```

<Callout>

Running the updates will migrate the legacy `next_extras` on-demand revalidation configuration to entity type config.

## next 1.3.0

1. Upgrade your Drupal site to use `next 1.3.0`

```sh
composer require drupal/next
```

2. Run updates:

```sh
drush updb
```

2. Edit the Next.js user and **assign them all the roles that are going to be used for scopes, including the administrator role and the Next.js role**. The granted roles will be filtered based on roles assigned to the current user.

3. Upgrade the `next-drupal` package to `1.5.0`. See the upgrade guide below.

## next-drupal 1.5.0

1. Upgrade to the latest version

```sh
yarn add next-drupal@latest
```

---

## next-drupal 1.4.0

<Callout icon="⚠️">

The `DrupalClient` is an optional feature. If you're running a site using `next-drupal 1.2 or below`, you can safely upgrade your site without any breaking changes.

</Callout>

1. Upgrade to the latest version

```sh
yarn add next-drupal@latest
```

2. Create a new `DrupalClient` in `lib/drupal.ts`

```ts title=lib/drupal.ts
import { DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"

export const drupal = new DrupalClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL,
  {
    frontPage: "/home",
    previewSecret: process.env.DRUPAL_PREVIEW_SECRET,
    auth: {
      clientId: process.env.DRUPAL_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.DRUPAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
  }
)
```

By default, all requests made to Drupal by `DrupalClient` are un-authenticated. See _Step 5_ below on how to configure permissions for un-authenticated calls.

To make authenticated requests, you opt-in on a [method-basis](/docs/authentication#method-authentication).

If you want to have all requests authenticated, you can use the [`withAuth`](/docs/configuration#withauth) option on the `DrupalClient`:

```ts
import { DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"

export const drupal = new DrupalClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL,
  {
    frontPage: "/home",
    previewSecret: process.env.DRUPAL_PREVIEW_SECRET,
    auth: {
      clientId: process.env.DRUPAL_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.DRUPAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
    // highlight-start
    withAuth: true,
    // highlight-end
  }
)
```

3. Update helpers to use the `drupal` client.

```diff
+ import { drupal } from "lib/drupal"


- await getPathsFromContext()
+ await drupal.getStaticPathsFromContext()


- await translatePathFromContext()
+ await drupal.translatePathFromContext()


- await getResourceFromContext()
+ await drupal.getResourceFromContext()
```

4. Replace `pages/api/preview.ts` with the following:

```diff
- import { DrupalPreview } from "next-drupal"
-
- export default DrupalPreview()

+ import { drupal } from "lib/drupal"
+
+ export default async function (request, response) {
+  return await drupal.preview(request, response)
+ }
```

5. On the Drupal site, visit `/admin/people/permissions/anonymous` and assign the **Issue subrequests** permission to the **Anonymous user** role: <br /><br />
   We do this because during the build phase, most of the requests for pages are anonymous requests. By assigning this permission, you can significantly decrease your site's build time. <br /><br />
   If you would rather keep requests authenticated, you can use the [`withAuth`](/docs/client/configuration#withauth) options.

6. Done. You are now ready to run your site using the new `DrupalClient`.
